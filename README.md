# Donut-Maze-Game

-This game was created using Python Turtle Graphics for the 20 Second Game Jam (Itch.io) in 2022.

-You are deployed in a randomly generated maze, and you have 20 seconds to collect as many donuts as you can.

-WASD to move the character up, down, left, and right

-This was one of my first python games, and I programmed it when I didn't know OOP, so there are no game objects.

-I hope to one day have the time to add OOP and fix some of the code.
